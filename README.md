# Los Osos 2422

I was working on the next EmProps release when accidentally I opened a link to a bear utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say "metabears"?

Enter Los Osos 2422. 

Four hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. 

They have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.

I took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or I am just hungry? The story will continue...

Los Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed by 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the incipient generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.

The project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them lasser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.
