# Los Osos 2422

I was working on the upcoming major EmProps release when accidentally I opened a link to a bear utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say "metabears"?

Enter Los Osos 2422. 

Four hundred years into the future, bears live in a peaceful civilization sustained by bamboo and salmon organized in seven districts. Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. 

They have different occupations: farmers, fishers, athletes, scientists, creators, engineers, investors, explorers, citizens, or... felons. Frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks, sometimes they also add bling to their outfits.

I took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas and luchadores forced me to escape.  This story will continue...

Los Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece that uses a set of hand-drawn assets and combines them together using a custom open-source library that allows them to be stacked with positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them lasser eyes or unshaved looks, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the professions, and chance control to allow precise feature control.
