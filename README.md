# Los Osos 2422

I was working on the next generative art piece for EmProps when the algorithm became self-aware and tried to escape. I managed to code a containment unit when accidentally I opened a link to a utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say "metabears"?

Enter Los Osos 2422. 

Six hundred years into the future, bears live in a peaceful civilization sustained by bamboo and salmon organized in seven districts. Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. 

They have an occupation based on their contribution to society: farmers, fishers, athletes, scientists, creators, engineers, investors, explorers, citizens, or... felons. Frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks, sometimes they also add bling.

They live in too much calm, but my presence pissed them off. Also, it looks like ninjas started to appear. I hope I didn't break something. 

There's still a lot to learn. This story will continue.
